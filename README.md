# Nathan Krupa's Experimental Githup Web Page 

## Websites are fun, especially when you discover new ways to do web publising.

I'm just learning to code, although I've been doing Wordpress development for a couple of years now. I have reached the limit of what I can do with plugins and themes, and want to learn more about the guts of how to code websites for real. 

I run two other websites:

[TheAlmoner.com](https://thealmoner.com): I'm a professional fundraiser in real life, and this blog shares my knowhow on raising money for good causes. 
[Demoniac.net](https://demoniac.net): My hobby is spiritual warfare and deliverance prayer. This newish blog shares my experiences. 


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/NathanKrupa/Web-Number-1/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/NathanKrupa/Web-Number-1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
